# Archived Shell Scripts

This directory contains shell scripts that are no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Files

- `fix-migrations.sh` - Legacy migration fix script
- `verify-local-migrations.sh` - Local migration verification script

## Note

These scripts are archived because:
1. Migration management is now handled through Supabase CLI
2. The functionality may have been superseded by other tools
3. They are kept for historical reference only

If you need to use any of these scripts:
1. Review the code carefully
2. Update any hardcoded paths or credentials
3. Test in a safe environment first
4. Consider whether the functionality is still needed
